# LuCI App Aurora Config

**English** | [简体中文](README_zh.md)

## Introduction

**LuCI App Aurora Config** is a configuration application built specifically for [luci-theme-aurora](https://github.com/eamonxg/luci-theme-aurora). More customization options will be added in future releases _(assuming I still have any hair left by then)_ .

With this application, you can configure:

- **Theme Colors** : A built-in color picker so you can fine-tune your personal aesthetic
- **Layout Options** : Adjust how secondary menus behave when the top navigation bar is floating

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- This application supports **luci-theme-aurora ≥ v0.8.9_beta** only
- Using older versions of the theme will cause the configuration to have no effect
